# 36802-TBA Bosch radar FINE per-track object table (0x280 block).
# Cross-car CONFIRMED 2026-06-07 (3 cars / 6 routes; 8905 tracks fused leadOne.dRel at R^2=0.975).
# This SUPERSEDES the coarse 0x2C8/0x2C9 selected-lead as the range source: the radar broadcasts up to
# 8 track records, each a 4-frame burst on consecutive IDs. Only the HEADER ID of each record carries
# RANGE, and only on the sub-frame tagged b1==0x74 (moving) OR b1==0x94 (stationary/decelerating motion
# class). Both share the SAME byte layout; the tag high nibble encodes motion class (7=moving, 9=stationary).
# The parser gates on BOSCH_RADAR_HDR_TAG_SET, skips idle/saturation
# sentinels, emits up to 8 RadarPoints (stable trackId per slot), and lets radard select the lead.
# IMPORTANT: these object frames are physically on openpilot CanBus.camera (rlog src=2, confirmed
# across 6 routes), NOT CanBus.radar (bus 0). The Bus.radar key below is only the DBC-name lookup;
# the parser's CAN bus is CanBus(CP).camera. Reconfirm the bus with a read-only sniff before trusting dRel.
#
# SLOT LIST -- the 8 header IDs in SWEEP/TRANSMIT ORDER (address-ascending; 0x280 leads, 0x2DC terminates,
# confirmed on-wire 2026-07-01). slot index == position in this list == trackId // TRACKID_STRIDE.
# 0x288 and 0x28C were ADDED 2026-07-01 (phantom-fix drives 00000002/00000003): a per-header validity sniff
# (tmp_radar/slot_map.py) showed the radar fills a near GROUP {0x280,0x284,0x288,0x28C} + a far GROUP
# {0x2D0,0x2D4,0x2D8,0x2DC}, but the OLD 6-slot list read the near group only PARTIALLY -- it polled the
# far slots 0x2D4/0x2D8/0x2DC (valid 1%/0%/0% of sweeps) while SKIPPING 0x288 (valid ~30%, 1059 tracks,
# median ~62 m) and 0x28C (~12%, 433 tracks). Reading the full 8-slot table is the physically-correct decode
# and gives fuller mid/far object coverage. 0x2DC stays LAST -> the sweep-coherent trigger (S4) is unaffected.
#
# SCOPE / VALIDATION (be honest): this was investigated as a fix for the 40-70 m false-closing / follow-too-far
# symptom, but an offline old-6-slot-vs-new-8-slot replay of both drives (tmp_radar/validate_replay.py,
# diag_lateral.py) showed it is NEUTRAL for that symptom -- only ~8% of the added-slot points are the actual
# vision lead (92% are OTHER objects), so lead coverage barely moved (22%->23%) and the false-closing did not
# drop. It is also NEUTRAL for phantom risk (closer-in-path frames 6.9%->7.0%). The real cause of the
# follow-too-far / jumping-chevron / tunnel-wall-phantom is radard (openpilot) fusing a CLOSER near-slot object
# than the vision lead and flip-flopping leadOne between them; the parser's per-slot vRel is faithful to the
# measured range motion. See tmp_radar/RADARD_HANDOFF.md. Kept here as a correctness/coverage improvement, NOT
# as the symptom fix.

# no Ghidra, no controlled/tape capture) -- radar-re/latscale/_rlog/{peter-3d,peter-49,joey}.md and
# radar-re/latscale/LATSCALE-SHIPPED.md. ~20,880 matched (radar-track <-> model-lead) frames across
# three cars:
#   * AZIMUTH wins every discriminating (high-lateral-motion) segment; richest segment (peter-3d seg168,
#     lateral -4.14..+5.38 m) full-sin R^2=0.946, Pearson r(off, asin(y0/rng)) = -0.965.
#   * RANGE-RATE is FALSIFIED: off vs relative velocity is flat to noise everywhere (R^2 0.01-0.08 on the
#     discriminating segments; pooled Pearson r ~= +0.045). b4:b5 is NOT a free vRel -- vRel stays DERIVED.
# So yRel is the lateral PROJECTION of the (range, azimuth) polar measurement, computed trigonometrically
# from dRel and the offset-binary angle -- NOT a linear m/LSB on the raw field:
#     yRel = -dRel * sin((b4b5 - 0x8000) * LAT_SCALE_DEG_PER_LSB * pi/180)
# The negative sign (right-of-center b4b5 -> negative yRel) is the rlog-confirmed convention; LAT_RAW is
# already (b4b5 - 0x8000) per the DBC offset -32768, so it feeds the sin directly.
#
# SCALE: ~0.0009-0.001 deg/LSB (per-source free fits: joey 0.000902, peter-3d 0.0007-0.00086,
# peter-49 0.0006). The firmware-static candidate 0.001462 deg/LSB is REJECTED by all three sources
# (joey nonlinear RMS 1.31 m vs 1.06 m at 0.001; peter-3d pooled R^2 0.215; peter-49 meters-R^2 -29).
# 0.001 deg/LSB is the shipped value: a clean round figure at the top of the converged band, the explicit
# recommendation of the two highest-n sources, and it beats 0.001462 decisively. MEDIUM confidence on the
# third significant figure (0.0007-0.001 residual ambiguity) and the ABSOLUTE boresight zero-offset is
# still unpinned (a per-mount bias the regression absorbed as a per-segment fixed effect) -- one parked
# tape-measure read, or the on-road read-only x31 SRAM cross-check in radar-re/azimuth_capture.py, would
# tighten both. The FIELD IDENTITY (azimuth, not range-rate) is HIGH confidence and settled.

BOSCH_RADAR_STALE_S = 0.15  # ~3 missed 20 Hz frames

# vRel discontinuity guard (slot-reuse defense). trackId == slot index, so if object A vacates a slot and
# object B enters the SAME slot in the next cycle WITHOUT an intervening empty/sentinel cycle, the naive
# d(dRel)/dt derivative would teleport vRel to a physically impossible value (e.g. an observed ~1928 m/s)
# for what radard then treats as one continuous object. Any implied |vRel| above this bound is therefore
# NOT a real relative speed -- it is a track swap. We REJECT that sample (vRel -> NaN, and re-seed the
# per-track history baseline to the NEW object's position) so the next clean cycle derives a real vRel
# from the new object instead of carrying a phantom. The bound is deliberately generous: a genuine
# fast-closing lead (stationary object at highway speed ~31 m/s, or a head-on ~60 m/s) is far below it,
# so no real lead is ever rejected; only the swap artifact (which is ~20x over) is.
#
# PHANTOM-BRAKE FIX (nrdrbranchdebug, route 0543acc22b): the original 100 m/s bound was FAR too loose --
# replay of the bookmarked drive showed the 0x280 decode emitting |vRel| up to 89.6 m/s and feeding
# radard 303 fused leads whose closing speed disagreed with the vision model by >4 m/s (118 of them with
# the radar inventing a hard-closing lead that vision did not see), the direct cause of the phantom
# braking. A genuine fast-closing lead for this Honda use case is a stationary object at highway speed
# (~31 m/s) or a hard head-on (~40 m/s); anything implying a faster instantaneous jump is a decode/swap
# artifact, so 30 m/s is the tighter slot-reuse BREAK bound (was 100).
BOSCH_RADAR_VREL_MAX = 30.0  # m/s; implied per-frame |jump speed| above this == swap artifact -> BREAK

# Emit-time vRel trust gate -- GRADUATED PERSISTENCE (replaces the old flat |vRel| cap, 2026-07-01).
# A flat magnitude cap (formerly PLAUSIBLE=20/30) is the wrong tool: it cannot tell a REAL fast closer from
# a phantom. A stopped car at highway speed closes at |vRel| up to ~30, so a low cap BLINDS us to distant
# stopped traffic (car doesn't slow), while a high cap lets phantoms through (phantom braking). Instead:
# the HIGHER the claimed |vRel|, the LONGER the track must have been cleanly tracked (settle cycles) before
# we trust it. A real fast closer persists as you approach and EARNS the trust; a short-lived phantom never
# accumulates it. (KF range-rate variance p11 was tested as the discriminator and REJECTED -- it converges
# to ~0.92 for every track regardless of quality; persistence is what actually separates real from phantom.)
# A hard physical ceiling still drops decode garbage outright.
# Validated on drive 00000007 highway seg 6/13/14/22 (n=5492): residual |vRel|>15 drops 101->~10, >20 -> 0,
# lead-retention preserved (~62%), and ZERO persistent (settle>=20) high-vRel tracks dropped -> a real
# stopped car is KEPT, unlike the flat cap. High-|vRel| detection is delayed by the settle requirement
# (~0.5-0.9 s) -- an accepted tradeoff; the PRIMARY distant-stopped-traffic fix is the azimuth/yRel
# calibration (far tracks are currently mis-placed laterally -> not fused by radard), see CAPTURE_SPEC.
